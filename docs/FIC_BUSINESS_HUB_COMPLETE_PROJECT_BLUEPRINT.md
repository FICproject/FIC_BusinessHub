  Project                FIC Business Hub
  Document               Complete Project Blueprint & Architecture Baseline
  Version                2.0
  Status                 Active Production Architecture
  Owner                  FIC (Federation of Indian Chambers / Business Hub Governance)
  Primary applications   Member Web Portal (`apps/web`), Admin Portal (`apps/admin`)
  Backend                Shared Modular Monolith API (`apps/backend`)
  Primary database       MongoDB (Mongoose ODM)
  Architecture           Turborepo + pnpm monorepo with centralized dynamic RBAC
  Core Governance Model  FIC Intermediary Governance (Direct partnerships retired to prevent business bypass)

## Document Evolution & Key Architectural Updates (v1.0 → v2.0)

1. **FIC Intermediary Governance Enforcement**: Standalone unmediated "Partnerships" have been permanently removed from the application architecture to prevent direct member-to-member bypass. All B2B trade inquiries, supplier discovery, subcontractor sourcing, and OEM tie-ups flow through the **Universal Services Marketplace**, **Enterprise Scaling Desk**, and **Facilitated Meetings Desk**. The legacy `/partnerships` route permanently redirects to `/my-requests`.
2. **Distinct Advisory Desks**:
   - **Business Ideas & Incubation Desk (`/business-ideas`)**: Focuses on **Stage 0 → 1** pre-launch concept validation, bilateral NDA protection, automated 3-metric feasibility scoring (Market Viability, Technical Feasibility, Commercial Scalability), and mentor review notes.
   - **Business Development & Enterprise Scaling (`/business-development`)**: Focuses on **Stage 1 → 10** operational bottleneck turnaround for existing operational enterprises, factory floor lean optimization, cloud ERP modernization, regional distributor channel expansion, and phased diagnostic roadmaps.
3. **Dedicated Student & Mentor Ecosystem**: Full specialized portals for:
   - **Student Talent & Skill Development (`/skill-development`)**: Masterclass discovery filtered by domain and language (Tamil, English, etc.), and 1-on-1 consultation booking.
   - **Mentor / Trainer Workspace (`/my-services`, `/my-requests`)**: Streamlined masterclass video upload form (Topic Domain, Language, Video File Upload, Duration, Curriculum), teaching services catalog, and consultation management (`Accept`, `Reject`, `Reschedule`, `Complete & Log Audit`).
4. **Motion for React Design System**: Migration to official `motion/react` v12+, standardized motion tokens, and layout-level zero-opacity protection to guarantee 100% viewport visibility on route navigation.
5. **Warm Ivory & Soft Sand Luxury Theme**: Sophisticated multi-color Warm Ivory (`#FAF7F2`) surface with deep Earth Brown text (`#51463F`, `#453A33`) exceeding WCAG AAA contrast (> 7.5:1 ratio).

# 1. Executive Summary

FIC Business Hub is a membership-based, intermediary-governed business,
professional and opportunity ecosystem. It brings eligible individuals,
MSMEs, manufacturers, freelancers, investors, mentors and students into
one trusted platform so they can discover capabilities, offer verified
services, validate business ideas, request enterprise scaling advisory,
access confidential private deal rooms, schedule expert consultations,
and engage in skill development.

The platform is neither a passive business directory nor an open,
unmoderated marketplace. **FIC acts as the sole coordinating intermediary
for all member-to-member business interactions.** Public listings never
expose private contact details or company identities; all inquiries,
tenders, and introductions are reviewed, verified, and facilitated
directly through FIC governance to protect the business model and
prevent off-platform bypass.

The monorepo encompasses two web applications and one backend API:
1. **FIC Business Hub Member Portal (`apps/web`):** Public marketing landing,
   dynamic registration, authenticated member workspace, universal services
   marketplace, incubation desk, enterprise scaling desk, private deal room,
   and student/mentor portals (Port 5173).
2. **FIC Admin Portal (`apps/admin`):** Super Admin, Admin, and Verification
   Executive operations workspace for KYC approvals, marketplace listing audits,
   scaling roadmaps, and meeting moderation (Port 5174).
3. **Shared Backend API (`apps/backend`):** High-performance Express + TypeScript
   modular monolith connected to MongoDB (Port 5000).

The member workspace is dynamically configured from a single source of truth
(`apps/web/src/services/dashboardConfig.ts`). Upon authentication, members
receive role-tailored navigation, KPIs, action cards, and specialized tracks
optimized for their specific industry track.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 2. Business Requirements Document (BRD)

## 2.1 Business vision

**Vision:** Bring every eligible enterprise, professional, innovator and
student into one trusted ecosystem and empower them to discover, offer
and execute business opportunities through FIC intermediary governance.

**Positioning statement:**\
"One Platform. Unlimited Opportunity Ecosystem."

## 2.2 Business objectives

-   Build a broad membership ecosystem for individuals and organizations aged 18 and above.
-   Allow members to both publish verified service capabilities and submit requirements.
-   Make approved services discoverable across all 10 business sectors via a Universal Marketplace.
-   Enforce FIC-mediated business introductions and eliminate direct unmoderated bypass.
-   Provide a dedicated **Incubation Desk** for early-stage (0 → 1) business ideas with structured feasibility scoring.
-   Provide an **Enterprise Scaling Desk** for operational (1 → 10) businesses facing bottlenecks.
-   Enable a **Confidential Private Deal Room** for institutional investment and capital syndication under strict non-disclosure.
-   Provide an integrated **Student & Mentor Ecosystem** for academic guidance, skill development masterclasses, and paid faculty consultations.
-   Deliver dynamic, role-tailored member dashboards from a unified code architecture.
-   Provide robust operations tooling for FIC staff to moderate requests, assign specialists, and manage KYC verification.

## 2.3 Target audiences

The platform must not be limited to the examples below. Categories and
subcategories must be configurable.

-   Business owners and entrepreneurs
-   Startup founders and business idea owners
-   Manufacturers, textile and garment businesses
-   Retailers, wholesalers, distributors and traders
-   Investors and funding seekers
-   Freelancers, developers and IT professionals
-   Students, teachers, mentors and trainers
-   Consultants and professional service providers
-   Agriculture and allied-business participants
-   Healthcare and wellness professionals
-   Creative and media professionals
-   Job seekers, unemployed individuals and retired professionals
-   Skilled workers and other eligible individuals

## 2.4 Business model

### Membership pricing -- current approved direction

  Membership period                   Fee
  --------------------- -----------------
  First year                          ₹99
  Second year onwards     ₹5,999 per year

-   The same membership fee applies across categories.
-   The first-year ₹99 offer must be clearly described as a first-year
    introductory offer.
-   Do not show fake crossed-out prices, fake savings or countdown
    timers.
-   Final tax treatment, GST display, invoice format, refunds,
    cancellation, renewal reminders and auto-renewal policy require FIC
    approval.
-   Payment does not itself activate full dashboard access.
-   KYC resubmission after rejection or additional-document request must
    not trigger a second membership charge.

### Potential future revenue

Membership fees are the currently defined revenue model. Other models
such as sponsored listings, premium promotion, business consultancy fees
or transaction fees must not be enabled until FIC defines pricing,
terms, operational ownership and legal treatment.

## 2.5 FIC intermediary model

FIC coordinates member-to-member requests. Public members see service
information but not provider identity or private contact information. A
member submits a request to FIC. FIC reviews the request, collects
requirements, identifies suitable providers internally, contacts the
provider and coordinates next steps.

The product must clearly explain what FIC does and does not guarantee. A
request, introduction or meeting must not be represented as a guarantee
of service delivery, funding, investment, partnership or business
success.

## 2.6 Business scope

### In scope for the planned product

-   Public landing page and information pages
-   Signup, login and age eligibility validation

    without required legal approvals
-   Guaranteed funding, guaranteed returns or guaranteed business
    outcomes

approved service listings - Service request volume -
Request-to-provider-match rate - Request completion rate - Business

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

These are seed records, not hardcoded application enums. Admin must be
able to add, edit, deactivate and reorder categories and subcategories.

A user has exactly one primary main category. Multiple subcategories may
be allowed only within that same category when configuration permits.

## 3.6 Dynamic details forms

Forms must be configuration-driven.

Example fields: - Textile manufacturer: business name, manufacturing
type, products, capacity, experience, location, applicable
registrations. - Student: education level, institution, course, skills,
career interests and mentoring needs. - Investor: preferred sectors,
investment range, investment readiness and preferred business stage. -
Freelancer: skills, experience, portfolio, services and availability.

Supported field types: - Text and textarea - Number and currency range -
Email, phone and URL - Date - Single-select dropdown - Multi-select -
Radio - Checkbox - File upload - Address/location fields - Conditional
sections - Repeatable groups, if needed

Every field configuration should support: - Stable field key - Label and
help text - Field type - Required/optional - Validation rules - Options
or option source - Conditional visibility - Display order -
Sensitive-data classification - Version and publication state

Do not execute arbitrary JavaScript from database form configurations.
Use a safe, predefined rule schema.

## 3.7 Membership and KYC

Payment statuses: - PENDING - PAID - FAILED - REFUNDED -
PARTIALLY_REFUNDED, only if provider and policy support it

Membership statuses: - PENDING - ACTIVE - EXPIRED - CANCELLED -
SUSPENDED

KYC statuses: - NOT_STARTED - PENDING - UNDER_REVIEW -
ADDITIONAL_DOCUMENT_REQUIRED - APPROVED - REJECTED

Account statuses: - ACTIVE - SUSPENDED - BLOCKED

Full access requires: - Account ACTIVE - Payment PAID - KYC APPROVED -
Membership ACTIVE

A renewal must not bypass an account block, suspension or revoked KYC
decision. Define how an approved KYC application is rechecked if
documents expire or a material profile change occurs.

## 3.8 Dynamic Role-Based Member Dashboard

One unified, dynamic frontend dashboard architecture driven by a single source
of truth (`apps/web/src/services/dashboardConfig.ts`), avoiding disparate codebases.

### Centralized Navigation & Roles
The top navigation header dynamically adapts according to the member's subcategory:

1. **Default Business Track (Business Owner, MSME, Manufacturer, Freelancer, Trader)**:
   - Header Tabs: `Dashboard`, `Marketplace`, `Business Ideas`, `Scaling`, `Investment`, `Meetings`, `My Requests`, `My Services`.
2. **Student Track**:
   - Header Tabs: `Dashboard`, `Marketplace`, `Business Ideas`, `Investment`, `Meetings`, `My Requests`, `Skill Development`.
3. **Mentor / Trainer Track**:
   - Header Tabs: `Dashboard`, `Marketplace`, `Business Ideas`, `Investment`, `Meetings`, `My Requests`, `My Services`.
4. **Professor / Faculty Track**:
   - Header Tabs: `Dashboard`, `Marketplace`, `Business Ideas`, `Investment`, `Meetings`, `My Requests`, `My Services`.

### Dashboard Architecture Components
- **Welcome & Identity Hero**: Displays member fullName, dynamic subcategory badge, account status, membership validity pill, and KYC verification status.
- **Dynamic KPI Stat Cards**: 4 responsive stat cards tailored to the member's subcategory (e.g. Registered Students, My Teaching Services, Client Inquiries, Active Deal Rooms).
- **Opportunity Actions & Services**: High-impact shortcut grid (7 to 8 actions) linking to core modules, explicitly labeled as *"Moderated by FIC Intermediary Governance"*.
- **Specialized Track Card**: A high-touch spotlight banner with key domain metrics (e.g. Student Talent Accelerator, Universal Service Marketplace Showcase).

## 3.9 Universal Services Marketplace (`/marketplace`)

Every eligible member can discover all approved, active services across **10 business sectors**
(Business & Entrepreneurship, Manufacturing, Technology, Education, Professional Services,
Agriculture, Investment & Finance, Healthcare, Creative Media, Employment & Community).

### Privacy & Governance Protocol
- Public listings **never** expose provider personal name, company name, private phone, private email, or direct contact links.
- Backend strictly enforces field-level privacy at the API layer.
- Member-to-member communication is coordinated directly by FIC Officers to eliminate spam and bypass.
- Public fields: Service title, category, subcategory, verified deliverables list, industry tags, FIC verification badge, response timeframe, and *"Request Service through FIC"* CTA.

## 3.10 Service Request Workflow

Lifecycle:
`SUBMITTED` → `UNDER_REVIEW` → `REQUIREMENTS_COLLECTED` → `ASSIGNED_TO_PROVIDER` → `PROPOSAL_SHARED` → `ACCEPTED` → `IN_PROGRESS` → `COMPLETED` → `CANCELLED` / `DISPUTED`.

1. Member submits a requirement for an approved marketplace service.
2. Request appears in member's **My Requests** desk (`/my-requests?tab=services`).
3. FIC Desk evaluates scope, confirms member eligibility, and coordinates with the service provider.
4. Proposal and deliverables are shared under FIC moderation.

## 3.11 Advisory Desks: Business Ideas vs Enterprise Scaling

The platform clearly distinguishes between early-stage innovation and existing business turnaround:

### 3.11.1 Business Ideas & Incubation Desk (`/business-ideas`) — *Stage 0 → 1*
Designed for innovators, students, researchers, and early entrepreneurs validating a **new concept**:
- **Form Inputs**: Idea Title, Detailed Concept Description, Target Market / Geography, Current Maturity Stage (*Idea on Paper, Prototype/MVP, Early Traction, Growth*), and Support Needed (*Idea Validation, Business Plan Preparation, Technology/MVP Development, Mentoring & Advisory, Regulatory Setup, Go-to-Market Strategy*).
- **IP Protection Guarantee**: Submissions are protected by strict bilateral non-disclosure protocols and reviewed only by accredited FIC consultants.
- **Feasibility Scoring Engine**: Submissions receive an automated diagnostic evaluation across:
  - *Market Viability (out of 100)*
  - *Technical Feasibility (out of 100)*
  - *Commercial Scalability (out of 100)*
- **Tracking Lifecycle**: `UNDER_REVIEW` → `FEASIBILITY_ANALYSIS` → `ADVISORY_SCHEDULED` → `APPROVED_INCUBATION`.
- **Review Notes & Next Steps**: Members receive diagnostic notes and structured next steps from senior incubation specialists.

### 3.11.2 Business Development & Enterprise Scaling (`/business-development`) — *Stage 1 → 10*
Designed for **established operational businesses, MSMEs, and factories** facing operational bottlenecks:
- **Form Inputs**: Enterprise Name, Required Growth Area (*Strategic Business Planning & Turnaround, Technology Modernization & Cloud Systems, Regional Expansion & Distributor Channel Onboarding, Operational & Factory Floor Lean Optimization, New Entity Setup*), Current Operational Bottlenecks, and Target Objectives / Milestones.
- **Specialist Assignment**: FIC assigns senior Domain Directors (e.g. Technology & Cloud Modernization Wing, FMCG & Commercial Retail Syndication).
- **Diagnostic Roadmaps & Milestones**: Specialists formulate phased transformation roadmaps:
  - *Phase 1: Diagnostic Assessment & Architecture Audit*
  - *Phase 2: Modernization Execution & Vendor Coordination*
  - *Phase 3: Performance Verification & Go-Live*
- **Tracking Lifecycle**: `DIAGNOSTIC_PENDING` → `SPECIALIST_ASSIGNED` → `ROADMAP_PREPARED` → `EXECUTION_IN_PROGRESS`.

## 3.12 Confidential Investment & Private Deal Room (`/investment`)

An institutional capital channel connecting high-growth enterprises with accredited syndicates:
- **Expression of Interest (EOI)**: Private submission for both capital seekers (ticket size, business stage, pitch deck) and investors (investment appetite, preferred sectors, liquidity horizon).
- **Private Deal Room Opportunities Bulletin**: Pre-screened commercial deals vetted by the FIC Senior Deal Committee (e.g. Tier-1 automated spinning units, solar cold-chain logistics, ayurvedic extraction facilities).
- **Bilateral NDA Protection**: Deal rooms require signed non-disclosure agreements before confidential financial data rooms are unlocked.
- **Compliance Protocol**: FIC does not hold investor custody, collect public deposits, or operate an unregistered securities exchange; operations are strictly structured as private B2B intermediary coordination.

## 3.13 FIC Intermediary Governance & B2B Coordination (Retirement of Direct Partnerships)

### Business Justification
In earlier specifications, a standalone "Partnerships" module allowed direct company-to-company connections. This created an existential business vulnerability: once Company A and Company B connected directly, FIC was bypassed in all subsequent commercial transactions.

### Architectural Policy
1. **Complete Removal of Standalone Partnerships**: The "Partnerships" module, navigation tabs, action shortcuts, and creation endpoints have been completely eliminated from the member portal.
2. **Redirect Strategy**: The route `/partnerships` permanently redirects to `/my-requests`.
3. **Mediated B2B Trade & Expansion**: Genuine B2B business collaboration (OEM supply chains, distributor onboarding, vendor sourcing, subcontracting) is routed strictly through the **Universal Marketplace**, **Enterprise Scaling Desk**, and **Facilitated Meetings Desk**, where FIC Officers oversee eligibility, vetting, and execution.

## 3.14 Student & Mentor Ecosystem

A comprehensive, role-tailored ecosystem connecting students and academic mentees with verified industry mentors and faculty:

### 3.14.1 Student Skill Development Portal (`/skill-development`)
- **Masterclass Video Discovery**: Filter verified video masterclasses by Topic Domain (Java, Python, Web Development, Digital Marketing, Mathematics) and Language (Tamil, English, Hindi, Kannada, Telugu).
- **Curriculum & Syllabus Details**: Students inspect video duration, target learning outcomes, and mentor credentials.
- **1-on-1 Mentor Consultation Booking**: Students can directly request a 1-on-1 career or academic guidance session with the mentor, specifying preferred dates, times, and meeting agendas.

### 3.14.2 Mentor Workspace & Video Upload Form (`/my-services`)
- **Streamlined Video Upload Form**: Eliminates obsolete fields (stream URL, target level, embed links) and focuses on core essentials:
  1. *Subject / Topic Domain* (Required)
  2. *Language* (Required — Tamil, English, etc.)
  3. *Video Masterclass File* (Required — Drag-and-drop file upload supporting MP4, WebM, MOV)
  4. *Session Duration* (Minutes)
  5. *Curriculum & Topic Description* (Required)
- **Teaching Services Catalog**: Mentors publish structured consulting and coaching tracks into the marketplace.

### 3.14.3 Mentorship Consultations Management (`/my-requests`)
Role-based tab separation in `MyRequestsPage.tsx`:
- **Mentor View**:
  - Displays `Marketplace Requests` and `Student Requests`.
  - Mentors can execute direct actions:
    - **Accept & Schedule**: Specify confirmed date, time, meeting mode (Online/Offline), Google Meet URL, and mentor notes.
    - **Reject Request**: Provide constructive feedback reason.
    - **Propose Reschedule**: Suggest alternative dates and times with notes.
    - **Complete Session & Log Audit**: Record session summary, mentor notes, recommended materials, and follow-up guidance before closing the booking.
- **Student View**:
  - Displays `Marketplace Requests` and `Mentor Requests`.
  - Students track booking status (`PENDING`, `ACCEPTED`, `RESCHEDULE_PROPOSED`, `COMPLETED`), access meeting links, and accept or decline mentor reschedule proposals.

## 4.3 Non-functional requirements

These are proposed engineering targets and must be validated against
budget, hosting and expected traffic.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  ID                                  Requirement
  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------
  NFR-001                             Responsive design for mobile,
                                      tablet and desktop.

  NFR-002                             Target monthly availability: 99.9%,
                                      subject to infrastructure and

  NFR-005                             Sensitive documents must be private
                                      and access-controlled.

  NFR-006                             Payment webhooks must be
                                      signature-verified and idempotent.

  NFR-007                             Public APIs must enforce data
                                      minimization and field-level
                                      access.

                                      tests.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4.4 Business rules

1.  Only users aged 18 or above may register.
2.  One account has exactly one primary main category.
3.  Subcategories must belong to the selected main category.
4.  Main categories and subcategories are database/configuration-driven.
5.  Membership first-year fee is ₹99; subsequent annual renewal fee is
    ₹5,999, subject to approved tax and terms.
6.  Payment does not grant full dashboard access by itself.
7.  KYC approval is mandatory for full access.
8.  KYC resubmission does not require another membership payment.
9.  Only active, approved and eligible service listings appear in the
    marketplace.
10. Marketplace discovery is universal across member categories.
11. Provider identity/contact details are not public.
12. Service and business introductions are coordinated through FIC.
13. Investment/funding information is restricted to authorized FIC
    personnel.
14. Student-to-mentor direct payment is not supported.
15. Membership renewal does not bypass account suspension/block or
    revoked KYC.
16. Configuration changes must not silently alter historical
    submissions.
17. Every sensitive status change must record actor, timestamp, reason
    and prior/new state.

## 4.5 Access decision logic

Full dashboard access:

`accountStatus == ACTIVE`\
AND `paymentStatus == PAID`\
AND `kycStatus == APPROVED`\
AND `membershipStatus == ACTIVE`

The backend must enforce this rule for protected APIs. Frontend route
guards are supplementary only.

## 4.6 State management

Keep account, payment, KYC, membership and listing states separate. Do
not compress them into one generic status.

Example: - Account: ACTIVE / SUSPENDED / BLOCKED - Payment: PENDING /
PAID / FAILED / REFUNDED - KYC: NOT_STARTED / PENDING / UNDER_REVIEW /
ADDITIONAL_DOCUMENT_REQUIRED / APPROVED / REJECTED - Membership: PENDING
/ ACTIVE / EXPIRED / CANCELLED / SUSPENDED - Service listing: DRAFT /
PENDING / APPROVED / REJECTED / SUSPENDED / ARCHIVED

Define allowed transitions and actor permissions in implementation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 6. Solution Architecture

## 6.1 Architecture style

Use a **modular monolith** initially. Keep domain modules separated
inside one backend deployment. Do not begin with microservices unless
scale, team ownership or operational needs justify them.

```

The structure is a recommended target. Create folders progressively as
modules are implemented; avoid empty folders being mistaken for
completed features.

## 6.3 Workspace configuration

`pnpm-workspace.yaml`:

``` yaml
packages:
  - "apps/*"
  - "packages/*"
```

Root `package.json` should: - Be private. - Pin the actual pnpm version
using the `packageManager` field. - Provide `dev`, `build`, `lint`,
`typecheck` and `clean` scripts. - Use a compatible Turborepo version.

Example root scripts:

``` json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "turbo dev",
    "build": "turbo build",
    "lint": "turbo lint",
    "typecheck": "turbo typecheck",
    "clean": "turbo clean"
  }
}
```

Example `turbo.json`:

``` json
{
  "$schema": "https://turborepo.dev/schema.json",
  "tasks": {
    "dev": {
      "cache": false,
      "persistent": true
    },
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": ["dist/**", "build/**"]
    },
    "lint": {
      "dependsOn": ["^lint"]
    },
    "typecheck": {
      "dependsOn": ["^typecheck"]
    }
  }
}
```

Use compatible, currently supported dependency versions at
implementation time. Do not blindly copy old version numbers from
examples.

## 6.4 Backend module pattern

Each backend domain module should follow a consistent structure where
appropriate:

``` text
module-name/
├── module-name.model.ts
├── module-name.types.ts
├── module-name.validation.ts
├── module-name.repository.ts
├── module-name.service.ts
├── module-name.controller.ts
├── module-name.routes.ts
├── module-name.permissions.ts
└── module-name.test.ts
```

Do not force every module to contain unnecessary files. Keep business
logic out of controllers and enforce authorization in
services/repositories as appropriate.

## 6.5 Environments and domains

Example: - Local web: `http://localhost:5173` - Local admin:
`http://localhost:5174` - Local API: `http://localhost:5000` -
Production web: `https://www.ficapp.in` - Production admin:
`https://admin.ficapp.in` - Production API: `https://api.ficapp.in`

Configure ports explicitly. Production deployment, DNS, TLS, CORS and
cookie domains require environment-specific configuration.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 7. Dynamic Configuration Architecture

## 7.1 Configuration-driven components

The following must be database/configuration-driven: - Main categories -
Subcategories - Registration fields - Conditional questions - KYC
document requirements - Dashboard menus - Dashboard widgets - Category
features - Subcategory feature variations - Service categories -
Relevant filters and metadata

## 7.2 Configuration lifecycle

Suggested states: - DRAFT - IN_REVIEW - PUBLISHED - ARCHIVED

Publishing creates an immutable configuration version. Existing
registrations should retain the version used at submission. Changes
should be migrated explicitly, not silently.

## 7.3 Dashboard renderer

The dashboard engine should: 1. Read the member's primary category and
permitted subcategories. 2. Resolve the published category
configuration. 3. Resolve applicable subcategory features. 4. Apply
member permissions and account state. 5. Render only supported, approved
widget types. 6. Fetch data through authorized APIs. 7. Display a
graceful fallback for disabled or unavailable widgets.

Do not allow arbitrary code execution from dashboard configuration. Use
a registry of approved widget components.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 8. Data Architecture and MongoDB Collections

The following is a logical collection inventory. Final schema details,
indexes and retention rules must be reviewed before production.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Avoid duplicating the same request across multiple collections without a
clear domain reason. Decide whether to use a shared request model with
typed payloads or separate domain collections based on query, privacy
and lifecycle needs.

## 8.1 User record principles

A user should contain: - Stable user ID - Authentication identifiers -
Account status - Primary category ID - Permitted subcategory IDs -
Registration/configuration version references - Membership/KYC
references or derived state - Created/updated timestamps

Do not store a `categories` array that allows multiple primary
categories. `primaryCategoryId` must be singular. Subcategories must be
validated against it.

## 8.2 Indexing

Plan indexes for: - Unique normalized email/mobile where policy
requires - Primary category and subcategory references -
Account/KYC/membership statuses - Membership expiry dates - Listing
status/category/search fields - Request status/assigned staff/created
date - Payment provider transaction IDs and webhook event IDs - Audit
actor/resource/timestamp - Notification recipient/read status

Use compound indexes based on actual query patterns. Validate index
impact with production-like data.

## 8.3 File storage

Store KYC and sensitive proposal documents in private object storage,
not public static folders. MongoDB should store metadata and object
references, not necessarily file bytes.

Use: - Encryption in transit and at rest - Short-lived signed URLs -
MIME/type and size validation - Malware scanning where feasible - Access
audit logs - Retention and deletion policies - Restricted staff access

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 9. API Specification

Use versioned REST APIs under `/api/v1`. Publish OpenAPI documentation.
All endpoints require explicit authentication and authorization
decisions.

# 10. UI/UX Specification

## 10.1 Design principles & Visual Identity

-   **Warm Ivory & Soft Sand Luxury Theme**: An earthy, warm, professional enterprise aesthetic avoiding harsh dark modes or stark pure black.
-   **WCAG AAA Contrast Standard**: All primary and secondary text uses Deep Earth Brown (`#51463F` and `#453A33`) exceeding 7.5:1 contrast ratios on ivory surfaces. No pale white text on light badges.
-   **Multi-Color Luxury Accents**:
    -   *Terracotta / Coral (`#E8795B`, `#C65638`)*: Primary brand emphasis, marketplace highlights.
    -   *Golden Amber (`#E5A23B`, `#D99B43`)*: Incubation ideas, validity indicators.
    -   *Forest Teal (`#3B9C91`, `#1C6960`)*: Private deal rooms, confidential investment badges.
    -   *Royal Violet (`#8064B1`, `#6E529F`)*: Scaling advisory, mentorship desk.
-   **Frosted Glass Card Surfaces**: White cards (`bg-white/80` or `bg-white/95`) with delicate sand borders (`#EDE2D7`) and soft depth elevation.
-   **Full Viewport Responsiveness**: High-density layouts spanning 320px to 1920px viewports without awkward empty margins.

## 10.2 Motion for React (`motion/react`) System

Standardized exclusively on **Motion for React** (`motion/react` v12+):
-   **Guaranteed Route Visibility**: Layout shells wrap routes without blocking initial zero-opacity transitions, eliminating blank-screen glitches during client-side tab switching.
-   **Motion Tokens**:
    -   *Durations*: Fast (150ms), Normal (260ms), Slow (400ms).
    -   *Springs*: Snappy (`stiffness: 380, damping: 28`), Gentle (`stiffness: 260, damping: 22`).
    -   *Easing*: Premium cubic-bezier curves (`[0.22, 1, 0.36, 1]`).
-   **Reusable Motion Primitives**: `AnimatedModal`, `AnimatedCard`, `AnimatedCounter`, `AnimatedProgress`, `ScrollReveal`, and `StaggerContainer`.

## 10.3 Centralized Role-Based Member Navigation

Navigation is dynamically generated via `getRoleNavigation(user)` in `apps/web/src/services/dashboardConfig.ts`:

-   **Business / MSME / Manufacturer / Freelancer (8 Core Modules)**:
    `Dashboard` • `Marketplace` • `Business Ideas` • `Scaling` • `Investment` • `Meetings` • `My Requests` • `My Services`
-   **Student (7 Core Modules)**:
    `Dashboard` • `Marketplace` • `Business Ideas` • `Investment` • `Meetings` • `My Requests` • `Skill Development`
-   **Mentor / Trainer (7 Core Modules)**:
    `Dashboard` • `Marketplace` • `Business Ideas` • `Investment` • `Meetings` • `My Requests` • `My Services`
-   **Professor / Faculty (7 Core Modules)**:

# 12. Security and Privacy Requirements

## 12.1 Authentication and authorization

-   Hash passwords using a suitable modern password-hashing algorithm.
-   Use secure session or access/refresh-token architecture.
-   Protect cookies appropriately if cookie-based sessions are selected.
-   Add login, OTP and sensitive-action rate limits.
-   Use RBAC and deny-by-default authorization.
-   Validate all input on the server.
-   Apply secure headers and CORS allowlists.
-   Protect against common OWASP risks.
-   Avoid logging secrets, OTPs or full sensitive document contents.

## 12.2 Identity privacy

Public marketplace responses must be constructed using explicit
allowlisted fields. Do not serialize complete member documents and
attempt to remove private fields afterward.

Private provider identity should be available only to authorized FIC
staff who need it for a request.

Member-to-member messages and uploaded content may contain phone
numbers, emails or external links. Absolute prevention cannot be
guaranteed. Use: - Clear policy and warnings - Detection and moderation
where feasible - Restricted message visibility - Staff review and
reporting - Enforcement and audit process

FIC must still publish its own legitimate business identity, support and
legally required grievance contact details.

## 12.3 Financial and payment security

-   Use a compliant payment provider.
-   Do not store card credentials.
-   Verify webhook signatures.
-   Make webhook processing idempotent.
-   Reconcile provider events with internal payment records.
-   Keep immutable provider transaction references.
-   Separate payment success from KYC approval and dashboard activation.
-   Define refund, cancellation and chargeback handling.
-   Do not enable investment money custody or transfer without an
    approved legal and technical model.

## 12.4 Sensitive files

-   Private object storage.
-   Encryption at rest and in transit.
-   Short-lived signed download links.
-   Role-checked access.
-   Malware scanning where feasible.
-   File size/type validation.
-   Audit document access.
-   Retention and secure deletion policy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 13. Indian Legal and Compliance Review

This section is a review checklist, not legal advice or a declaration of
compliance.

Obtain qualified Indian legal, CA and regulatory advice before launch.

Review applicability of: - Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023
and rules/commencement requirements applicable at launch - Information
Technology Act and applicable rules - Consumer Protection Act and
E-Commerce Rules, where applicable - GST registration, tax treatment,
invoicing and accounting - Payment aggregator/provider contractual and
regulatory requirements - KYC and record-retention obligations
applicable to FIC's actual business activities - Sector-specific
requirements for finance, healthcare, education and other regulated
areas - Investment solicitation, securities, lending, collective
investment, deposit-taking and financial-advisory boundaries -
Employment, contractor, mentor and service-provider agreements -
Grievance handling, refunds, cancellations and dispute resolution

Do not assume that describing FIC as an intermediary automatically
exempts it from legal responsibilities. Legal classification depends on
actual activities, contracts, money flows, representations and control.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 14. Mentoring and FIC-Funded Commission

## 14.1 Approved operating direction

-   Students request mentoring through FIC.
-   Students do not pay mentors directly.
-   FIC manages mentor selection, session tracking and quality
    evaluation.
-   FIC pays eligible mentors from an approved company budget.
-   Payout is subject to completed sessions, attendance, feedback,
    complaint checks, approval and reconciliation.

## 14.2 Suggested workflow

1.  Student requests mentoring.
2.  FIC reviews and assigns/coordinates mentor.
3.  Session is scheduled.
4.  Attendance and completion are recorded.
5.  Student submits feedback.
6.  FIC evaluates mentor performance.
7.  Eligible commission/payout is calculated using approved configurable
    rules.
8.  Authorized staff approve.
9.  Finance executes payout through approved provider/process.
10. Ledger and payout status are reconciled.

Commission percentages, score weights, payout rates and budget amounts
are not finalized. Store them as effective-dated configuration, with
approval history.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 15. Notifications and Communication

Support notification channels as configured: - In-app notifications -
Email - SMS - Other approved channels

Events may include: - Registration created - Payment success/failure -
KYC submitted - KYC additional documents requested - KYC
approved/rejected - Dashboard activated - Membership expiry reminders -
Service listing approved/rejected - Service request status changed -
Business request update - Meeting scheduled - Networking/partnership
update - Mentor session update - Complaint update

Use notification templates with versioning. Do not expose sensitive
information in notification previews. Provide user preferences where
appropriate and honor required transactional communications.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 16. Reporting and Analytics

## 16.1 Admin dashboard metrics

Potential KPIs: - Total registered members - Active members - Pending
KYC - Approved KYC - Expired memberships - Membership revenue - Payment
failures/refunds - Active service listings - Pending listing approvals -
Service requests by status - Business development requests -
Investment/funding interest counts - Partnership/networking requests -
Complaints and resolution time - Mentor sessions and payouts

Define each metric, filters, timezone, source of truth and calculation
before presenting it as a financial or operational fact.

## 16.2 Privacy

Reports must use role-appropriate aggregation. Restrict personally
identifiable and financial information. Export permissions must be
separately controlled and audited.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 17. Testing Strategy

## 17.1 Testing levels

-   Unit tests for business logic and validators
-   Integration tests for database and API modules
-   API contract tests
-   Frontend component tests
-   End-to-end user journeys
-   Role/permission tests
-   Security and privacy tests
-   Payment webhook tests
-   File upload tests
-   Performance/load tests
-   Backup and restore tests
-   Responsive and accessibility tests

## 17.2 Critical test scenarios

### Registration

-   Under-18 user cannot proceed.
-   User can select only one primary category.
-   Subcategories are limited to selected category.
-   Dynamic form changes correctly.
-   Required conditional fields validate correctly.
-   Configuration version is stored with submission.

### Payment

-   Successful provider webhook updates payment exactly once.
-   Duplicate webhook does not duplicate membership.
-   Frontend cannot forge payment success.
-   Failed payment does not activate membership.
-   KYC resubmission does not charge again.
-   Refund/chargeback updates access according to policy.

### KYC and access

-   Pending KYC cannot access protected dashboard APIs.
-   Approved KYC plus paid active membership grants access.
-   Suspended/blocked account cannot bypass restrictions.
-   Additional-document request allows resubmission.
-   Staff actions are audited.

### Marketplace privacy

-   Every eligible category can discover all approved services.
-   Inactive/unapproved services are hidden.
-   Public API never returns provider name/company/private contact.
-   Authorized FIC staff can access provider details for assigned work.
-   Search and filters do not leak hidden fields.

### Business and investment workflows

-   Requests are visible only to requester and authorized FIC staff.
-   Investment amounts are not exposed publicly.
-   Consent and staff actions are recorded.
-   No unapproved money-transfer functionality is available.

### Dashboard configuration

-   Correct category dashboard loads.
-   Subcategory features apply correctly.
-   Draft configuration is not public.
-   Published version is stable.
-   Old submissions remain associated with their original version.

## 17.3 Definition of Done

A feature is complete only when: - Requirements are documented. - UI and
backend are integrated. - Authorization is enforced. - Validation and
error handling exist. - Tests pass. - Privacy/security checks pass. -
Relevant API documentation is updated. - Acceptance criteria are met. -
No fake success or placeholder integration is represented as
production-ready.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 18. Deployment and Infrastructure

## 18.1 Suggested deployment topology

-   Member website: static/web hosting behind CDN
-   Admin website: separately deployed web application
-   Backend: managed application/container hosting
-   MongoDB: managed MongoDB deployment
-   Redis: managed Redis if background jobs or caching require it
-   Object storage: private bucket for KYC and sensitive files
-   CDN: public assets only; never publicly cache private KYC documents
-   Monitoring: centralized logs, metrics, uptime and error tracking

## 18.2 Environment separation

Maintain separate: - Local development - Development/test - Staging -
Production

Use separate databases, storage buckets, credentials and
payment-provider modes. Production secrets must never be committed to
Git.

## 18.3 Environment variables

Provide `.env.example` with variable names and safe placeholders, for
example:

``` env
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=
REDIS_URL=
JWT_ACCESS_SECRET=
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=
WEB_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173
ADMIN_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5174
PAYMENT_PROVIDER_KEY=
PAYMENT_PROVIDER_SECRET=
PAYMENT_WEBHOOK_SECRET=
OBJECT_STORAGE_BUCKET=
OBJECT_STORAGE_REGION=
OBJECT_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY=
OBJECT_STORAGE_SECRET_KEY=
EMAIL_PROVIDER_API_KEY=
SMS_PROVIDER_API_KEY=
```

Do not commit real values. Prefer a managed secret store in production.

## 18.4 CI/CD

Suggested pipeline: 1. Install dependencies using lockfile. 2. Lint. 3.
Typecheck. 4. Unit and integration tests. 5. Build all applications. 6.
Security/dependency checks. 7. Deploy to staging. 8. Run smoke tests. 9.
Obtain production approval. 10. Deploy production and verify health.

Use database migration/index rollout procedures and rollback plans.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 20. Project Management and Governance

## 20.1 Required project artifacts

This consolidated document is the baseline. For larger teams, split it
into: - BRD.md - PRD.md - SRS.md - SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md -
DATABASE_SCHEMA.md - API_DOCUMENTATION.md - UI_UX_SPECIFICATION.md -
SECURITY_AND_PRIVACY.md - TESTING_STRATEGY.md -
DEPLOYMENT_AND_INFRASTRUCTURE.md - IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md -
OPEN_DECISIONS.md

Maintain one documentation index and version consistency.

## 20.2 Change control

Every material change should record: - Change ID - Requester - Reason -
Affected business rule - Affected UI/API/database/security/test areas -
Cost and schedule impact - Approval - Version and effective date

Do not change membership pricing, investment workflow, privacy policy or
KYC policy through an undocumented code change.

## 20.3 Traceability

Maintain a traceability matrix:

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Expand this matrix during detailed implementation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 21. Acceptance Criteria -- Product-Level

The initial release is acceptable only when:

1.  A visitor can understand FIC's purpose and start registration.
2.  A person under 18 cannot register.
3.  A member can select exactly one primary category.
4.  Subcategories and details questions load dynamically.
5.  Admin can manage category and form configuration.
6.  The first-year ₹99 price and second-year ₹5,999 renewal are
    accurately disclosed according to approved tax/terms.
7.  Payment is verified server-side.
8.  KYC requirements are category/subcategory-aware.
9.  Full dashboard access is blocked until all activation conditions
    pass.
10. KYC correction does not create a duplicate membership charge.
11. A single dashboard engine renders different category experiences.
12. Members can discover approved services from all categories.
13. Public service APIs do not reveal provider identity/company/private
    contact details.
14. Service requests are routed through FIC.
15. Business development, investment interest, funding, partnership and
    networking requests can be securely submitted and tracked.
16. Investment and funding details remain private to authorized FIC
    staff.
17. Mentoring does not collect direct student-to-mentor payment.
18. Admin actions and sensitive data access are auditable.
19. Critical end-to-end, privacy and authorization tests pass.
20. Legal, tax, privacy and operational launch dependencies have been
    reviewed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 22. Assumptions and Recommendations

These points are proposed unless explicitly approved by FIC:

-   The initial architecture is a modular monolith.
-   The first-year membership period begins on successful payment,
    subject to approved terms.
-   The member dashboard remains restricted while KYC is pending.
-   KYC rejection permits correction/resubmission without another
    membership charge.
-   Multiple subcategories may be allowed within one primary category if
    configured.
-   Service visibility requires provider eligibility, active membership,
    approved KYC and listing approval.
-   Service location is privacy-safe and configurable.
-   Category and dashboard configurations are versioned.
-   Investment/funding features initially manage private interest and
    introductions only.
-   Mentor payout rules are configurable and funded by FIC's approved
    budget.
-   Proposed uptime/performance/accessibility targets are engineering
    goals, not guarantees.

# 24. Open Decisions Requiring FIC Approval

Do not invent answers to these questions. Record the final decision,
owner and approval date.

## Membership and finance

1.  Is ₹99 inclusive of GST or exclusive?
2.  Is ₹5,999 inclusive of GST or exclusive?
3.  Is renewal manual or automatic?
4.  What is the exact grace period after expiry?
5.  What is the refund/cancellation policy?
6.  What happens if payment succeeds but KYC is never completed?
7.  Are partial refunds or chargebacks supported?
8.  What invoice and accounting process will be used?

## Registration and KYC

9.  Which identity and business documents are mandatory for each
    subcategory?
10. Which categories require enhanced verification?
11. What is the expected KYC review SLA?
12. Can a member change their primary category later? If yes, what
    approval and migration process applies?
13. Are multiple subcategories allowed for every category or configured
    individually?

## Marketplace and service operations

14. Does FIC charge a coordination fee, service fee or commission? No
    fee should be assumed until approved.
15. What service-provider response SLA applies?
16. How are quotes, proposals, cancellation and disputes handled?
17. What information may be shared with the provider after requester
    consent?
18. Which locations may be displayed publicly?
19. What is the service listing validity and renewal policy?

## Investment and funding

# 25. Final Instruction to Antigravity / Development Team

Use this document as the baseline product and technical specification.

Before coding: 1. Inspect the existing repository. 2. Confirm the two
websites and one shared backend architecture. 3. Validate the monorepo
foundation. 4. Review this document with the FIC business owner. 5.
Resolve critical open decisions. 6. Produce a phased implementation plan
and traceability matrix.

Do not: - Build separate applications for each category. - Hardcode
category/subcategory lists into application logic. - Create separate
dashboard codebases for every category. - Restrict universal marketplace
visibility by a member's primary category. - Expose provider identity or
private contact details in public APIs. - Activate full dashboard access
based on payment alone. - Charge again for KYC resubmission. - Create
direct student-to-mentor payments. - Enable unapproved investment
transactions or money custody. - Claim that a feature is complete
without implementation and testing. - Replace existing working code
without inspection and approval.

Build incrementally, preserve existing work, use typed contracts,
validate at API boundaries, enforce authorization on the server, and
maintain tests and documentation.

**Product outcome:** A configurable, privacy-conscious FIC Business Hub
where eligible people can join, offer and discover services, submit
business opportunities, seek development support, express
investment/funding interest and build partnerships through FIC's
coordinated ecosystem.
